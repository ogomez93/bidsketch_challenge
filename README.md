# Bidsketch Coding Challenge

This is my solution for the Bidsketch Coding Challenge.

This project uses:
- Ruby 2.4.1
- Rails 5.1.1
- Yarn 1.16.0
- Node 12.3.1

To see the page:
- clone this repo
- open a terminal
- `cd to/the/folder/you/cloned/at`
- run `bundle install`
- run `rails db:create`
- run `rails db:migrate`
- run `rails s`
- open another terminal
- in that new terminal, run `yarn`
- then run `yarn start`
- go to your browser at [localhost:3000/new_document](localhost:3000/new_document)

To test:
- `cd to/the/folder/you/cloned/at`
- run `rails test`
